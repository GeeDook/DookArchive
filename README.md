## Why Documentation Matters in Open Source

Many open-source projects fail due to poor documentation. Even the best code is useless if people don’t know how to use or contribute to it. Documentation bridges the gap between code and usability, making projects more accessible and encouraging collaboration.

📌 **Without Documentation:**
- ❌ Users don’t know how to use the project.
- ❌ New contributors struggle to participate.
- ❌ Debugging and issue resolution take longer.

💡 **Why Should You Care?**
- Contributors need clear guides to collaborate effectively.
- Beginners rely on documentation to learn and get involved.
- Maintainers can grow their projects faster with good documentation.
